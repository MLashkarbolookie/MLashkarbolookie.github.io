      <strong> Prosocial Disclosure and Contracts; Value and Values <strong>

      <strong>Abstract/</strong> </p>
       <p> I study the disclosure of prosocial performance (e.g., ESG) in a multi-tasking principal-agent framework with limited liability and private agent types. The agent derives utility from exerting costly effort on two tasks that benefit the principal: one with an unverifiable outcome and one with a verifiable outcome upon disclosure. The agentâ€™s private type, their utility and cost structure, influences the principal's incentive to contract on the verifiable outcome. The main result shows that when voluntary costly disclosure serves as a screening device for the principal, mandatory disclosure regulation can reduce prosocial effort and overall welfare. The model helps explain the limited use and effectiveness of ESG-contingent contracts, despite the availability of verifiable performance metrics.

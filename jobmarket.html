      <strong> Prosocial Disclosure and Contracts; Value and Values </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies the disclosure of prosocial performance (e.g., ESG) in a multitasking principal-agent framework with limited liability and private agent types. The agent derives utility from exerting costly effort on two tasks that benefit the principal: one yielding an unverifiable outcome, and another producing an outcome that becomes verifiable through costly disclosure. The agentâ€™s private type, reflected in their utility and cost structure, influences the principal's incentive to contract on the verifiable outcome. The resulting equilibrium offers a theoretical explanation for the observations regarding heterogeneities in prosocial contracts (e.g., sustainability linked loans), and helps explain empirical patterns consistent with social or green washing. The main result is the ambiguous impact of mandatory disclosure regulations. When voluntary costly disclosure serves as a screening device for the principal, resulting in a partial disclosure equilibrium, mandatory disclosure regulation can reduce prosocial effort and overall welfare. Conversely, mandating disclosure can enhance prosocial incentives and outcomes when the voluntary regime admits a non-disclosure equilibrium.  </main>

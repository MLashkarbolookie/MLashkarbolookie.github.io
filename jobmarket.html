      <strong> Prosocial Disclosure and Contracts; Value and Values </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies the disclosure of prosocial performance (e.g., ESG) in a multitasking principal-agent framework with limited liability and privately known agent types. The agent derives utility from exerting costly effort on two tasks that benefit the principal: one yielding an unverifiable outcome, and another producing an outcome that becomes verifiable through costly disclosure. The agentâ€™s private type, reflected in their utility and cost structure, influences the principal's incentive to contract on the verifiable outcome. The resulting equilibrium offers a theoretical explanation for the limited adoption and mixed effectiveness of prosocial contracts (e.g., sustainability linked loans), despite the availability of verifiable performance metrics, and helps explain empirical patterns consistent with social or greenwashing. Moreover, the main result shows that when voluntary costly disclosure serves as a screening device for the principal, mandatory disclosure regulation can reduce prosocial effort and overall welfare   </p>
